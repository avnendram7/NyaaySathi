<analysis>original_problem_statement:
The initial request was to read  and then show a screenshot of the user dashboard.
Subsequent requests from the user were:
- Add other colors to the dashboard as not all features are visible, then show a preview.
- Fix the backend as the user is unable to create an account in the user get started flow.
- check everything (implies comprehensive testing).
- Fix law firm lawyer dashboard login.
- Fill lawyer of law firm everything with dummy data.
- Fill dummy calendar, performance, and messages for the firm lawyer dashboard.
- Update new law firm application so it can be approved via the admin dashboard.
- Implement a booking consultation flow where a dummy payment comes first, then a dummy dashboard option to add, then payment after clicking done, allowing login through user login with dummy payment data.
- Address issues: unable to login after signup, signup page not showing new law firm, and a separate section to approve client law firm applications for login.
- fix the errors.
- The payment gateway is not visible.
- Fix fail to approve application.
- In user add 2 option when get started first independent lawyer or law firm two card both with ai assistant and manually all law firm data from law firm that are registered law firm data will help user identify the option of law firms that best suit there same signup and payment gateway according to law firm charges keep some data dummy so it look good and after payment gateway in law firm tell user that hey can login in law firm client option to see there dashboard lawyer case update etc.
- Clarification:
    1. For law firms, both approved and dummy firms should be shown.
    2. Use the demo dashboard for firm clients.
    3. Make lawyer fees variable instead of fixed ₹999.
- Admin dashboard is not working, fix firm client dashboard approve and reject.
- When clicking Get Started as a user, there should be two cards: I want a lawyer and I want a law firm.
