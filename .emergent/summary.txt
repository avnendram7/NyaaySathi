<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initiated a major UI overhaul, starting with a request to change ui according to new homepage based on provided screenshots. This evolved into several distinct tasks:
1.  Create a new set of user flow pages (, , , etc.) with a light, professional theme.
2.  Implement a unified login page for all user roles (User, Lawyer, Law Firm) that supports email and password authentication.
3.  Fix the backend integration to ensure the new login page works correctly with the existing authentication API endpoints.
4.  Resolve a UI bug where typed text in input fields was not visible against the light background.
5.  Redesign several existing dark-themed pages (Lawyer Application, Law Firm Registration, etc.) to match the new light theme.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Theme:** Light, professional, and smooth UI.
-   **Color Scheme:** Light backgrounds with black text for input fields and Admiral Blue (#0F2944) for accents.
-   **Functionality:**
    -   A unified login page accessible from any Login button.
    -   The login page must provide options for User, Lawyer, and Law Firm roles.
    -   All buttons throughout the new and redesigned pages must be functional and navigate correctly.
    -   Backend authentication must work seamlessly with the frontend.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A suite of new frontend pages has been created, establishing a new light and professional design language for the application. A core achievement is the implementation of a  page, which centralizes the login process for all user roles. The frontend has been successfully connected to the backend's authentication endpoints, and the entire login flow—from clicking Login on the homepage to successful authentication—is functional. A UI bug preventing typed text from being visible in input fields has also been resolved across all newly created pages. However, several older pages still retain the previous dark theme and need to be redesigned.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent fixed a UI bug across all newly created pages where the text being typed into input fields was not visible. The text color was changed to black for better contrast on the light background.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React Router ()
-   **Backend:** FastAPI
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Architecture:** Full-stack with separate frontend/backend directories.

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** The agent interacted with the user schema, noting the requirement for a  field during registration. No changes were made to the schema itself.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/UnifiedLogin.js**: Newly created page that handles authentication for all user roles. Heavily modified to integrate with the backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Modified to add routes for all new pages and to direct all login traffic to .
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/RoleSelection.js**: Modified to fix navigation to the next steps in the user flow.
-   **/app/backend/routes/auth.py**: Inspected to understand the required API payload for the  endpoint.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/{AIChat.js, AILawFirmFinder.js, BrowseFirms.js, BrowseLawyers.js, FindLawyer.js, LegalAssistanceSelection.js}**: All newly created and modified to fix the input text color.
-   **/app/DUMMY_CREDENTIALS.md**: New file created to document test user credentials.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The five existing dark-themed pages listed under **Upcoming Tasks** require a complete UI refactor to match the new light theme.

**key api endpoints**
-   : The unified login endpoint. The frontend was updated to correctly use this endpoint, passing a  field in the request body.
-   : The user registration endpoint. The agent discovered it requires a  field.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The immediate priority (P0) is to redesign the 5 specified dark-themed pages to match the new light, professional theme. The user has explicitly requested this.
-   The authentication system is now centralized and working. The key file for this logic is .
-   When creating or modifying forms, ensure input fields have  or an equivalent style to ensure text is visible on the light theme. This was a specific user complaint that has been fixed and should be maintained.
-   Refer to  for testing login functionality.
