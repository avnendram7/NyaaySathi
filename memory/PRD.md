## Completed Bug Fixes

### Jan 29, 2026 - Law Firm Client Login with Admin Approval
**Issue:** Users could not login through the Firm Client Login page, and admin approval was required

**Root Cause:** 
1. JoinFirmSignup.js was registering users via `/api/auth/register` (stores in `users` collection) but FirmClientLogin.js was checking `/api/firm-clients/login` (looks in `firm_clients` collection)
2. No admin approval flow existed

**Fix Applied:** 
1. Updated JoinFirmSignup.js to use `/api/firm-clients/register-paid` endpoint
2. New users are registered with `status: pending_approval`
3. Users cannot login until admin approves them
4. Admin can view and approve pending clients from Admin Dashboard → Firm Clients tab
5. After approval, status changes to `active` and user can login

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/firm-clients/pending-approvals` - Get all pending clients
- `PUT /api/firm-clients/{client_id}/approve` - Approve/reject client

**Flow:**
1. User signs up → gets "pending admin approval" message
2. Admin views pending clients in Admin Dashboard
3. Admin clicks Approve → client status = "active"
4. User can now login at /firm-client-login

**Test Credentials:**
- Client Email: newtest@example.com
- Client Password: Test@123
- Admin Email: admin@lxwyerup.com
- Admin Password: admin123
